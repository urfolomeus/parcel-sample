A code reduction to demonstrate an issue I'm having.

## Steps

1. Open in a browser by running `npm start` or `yarn start` and visiting <http://localhost:1234>.
2. Open file *app/assets/stylesheets/global.css* in your favourite editor and change the color on line 9. Color will hot update in the browser.
3. Open file *app/Application.css* in your favourite editor and change the color on line 10. All styles from that file will break in the browser.
